# Final Project

## Proposal

### Objectives
I will create a script which analyzes how well-studied a group of fossil organisms is using data from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/). The goal is to quanify the research effort for a clade in the database to aid in detecting sampling bias.

### Data Sources
All data are downloaded from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/), which is a free, public source. Each entry is a fossil occurence. The pertinent attributes for this project would be the reference, reference year, and taxonomy for each entry.

### Languages used
I will be putting this together in R. I intend to use the [PaleobioDB](https://github.com/ropensci/paleobioDB) package to download the data, run the analysis with my own code, and plot the results with [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).
